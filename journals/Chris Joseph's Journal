    A group meeting was held in person in Lab 3 on UWI campus. The project was discussed in 
detail and a project specification document was constructed (though not completed). We arranged 
our various roles for the first SCRUM sprint and we also arranged meeting times which will take 
place on discord.

    A group meeting was held on discord detailing the next steps being taken. A document is being 
put together, highlighting possible questions for a questionnaire. This draft will be passed along 
to Kyle for review before it will be used to further strengthen our functional and non-functional 
requirements. 
    After our requirements are fleshed out, different group members will be assigned to construct 
UML diagrams as necessary.
