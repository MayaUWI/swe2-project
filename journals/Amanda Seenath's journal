Our group met for our first physical meeting where we further discussed our initial project idea and specified its details.
We discussed our experience with different technologies and agreed on those that would be utilized in the development of the project.
Each member requested a particular SCRUM role for the first sprint, with myself being part of the team.
We collaboratively drafted a requirements document while also completing the first project milestone.
We also compared class schedules and determined an appropriate time and method of communication for our scheduled meetings.

Tonight we conducted our first scheduled meeting on Discord promptly at 10:00pm.
After redownloading the client and adjusting volume levels we began discussion of the project.
We finalized the first milestone to submit and we began preparing for our second milestone.
This involved deciding on the requirements of the systen, both functional and non-functional.
In doing so we decided that we needed to conduct more primary research, rather than just utilize the information we
gathered from conversations with other students.
We looked at already existing software to identify what the market was like and what we needed to address to give us
an advantage with our application. We chose to do a questionnaire and brainstormed questions that needed to be asked.
A 'passive' meeting was to be held on Saturday to discuss any additional items that needed to be included in the
Questionnaire before submitting it to be reviewed by Kyle, and then dissemination.

We also detailed the specifics of what needed to be completed for the second milestone so that all members would have an
idea of the upcoming work to be done.
