- A meeting was held in the Computer Science Lab 3 where all the group members were present.
- We agreed upon the roles for the first sprint, where I opted to be a team member.
- However, this meeting was important as it allowed us to finalise the project idea as well as a general overview. 
- The meeting was successful as all group members understood what was expected of them in their scrum roles.
- We all helped to put together a Google Docs document with our project milestone 1
